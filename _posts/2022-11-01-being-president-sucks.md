I often think about my role in changing the way my country is going. 

As most idealistic, highly ambitious, young people, I try to imagine myself leading my developing country into a new, abundant future and the simple enough way of doing this always seems to be, of course, politics. 

##### However, playing to be president turns out to be a fascinating activity but ultimately an awful idea.

We start by the simplest test: asking ourselves the way to get to a position of power. 

In Mexico, there are two ways of doing that: either you make a career on a political party and eventually get elected as candidate or you run independently, by your own. 

- Political career building is the easiest to deem inefficient: it is not only a huge time investment (and probably not a worth one unless you’re trying it full time, full focus) but also, as you get up in the ranks, you get involved with the social mechanics, favor-debt and overall annoying party alignment. Even winning, you’re not able to get rid of all these dead weight.
- Running as an independent candidate is also not particularly better and significantly harder. Because even winning (with all the hardship that endues), you still don’t control the social organisms! No senate no party, unfortunately. Which means, they give you a really cool title to get your ideas rejected.

Understandably, politics is getting along with people and trying to get a good outcome in the end, which works ok in the developed world. However, I’m thinking specifically on Mexico, which offers a buffet of poisoning political dishes. Debt-owning means bribes, party alignment means corruption and favor-debt, well that’s self explanatory. Every single country has a level of these on their back kitchen, but with Mexico you can see them from the street. 

Now, even after winning, you have to think what you get to manage: Mexicans' money. Government money is finite and extremely hard to organize, most presidents don’t cut programs out of pure evil, they mostly do it to fund other projects. Yeah, you can always get in debt! But that also comes with the risk of turning into Japan (paying ~20% of your GPD on external debt) or, most likely, worse.

And then again, even using the money for useful things, you still hit the time barrier of 6 years, after which you are done and have to leave everything on the fate of whoever comes next. 

Now you get to the obvious answer: dictatorship! But that, even with the absolute best intentions, goes against basically everything modern universal morality has built (plus you get killed by a superpower).

In conclusion, even without going to specific details on campaign running, the headache of dealing with local leaders and assuming you win absolutely everything and not lose your time, well, losing, being president is an incredibly poorly effort/time inefficient way of making a significant impact.

It seems like the examples of people waging politics as a trascendental force (measured in terms of impact, for better of worse; Hitler, Diaz, Mandela, Ataturk, Putin, etc) are more a consequence of their times rather than an effective example of political power.
