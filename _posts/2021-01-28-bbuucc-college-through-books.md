### An iniciative to bring the academic college path through the most significant books

I've been on college for a few years and couldn't help but notice that it can be absolutely useless for learning. The thing is even if your proffessor'sreally good (not great), you're still probably better off with a book. And it has nothing to do with the ability of teachers, it's simply just that understanding is only possible within one self, once the concepts are digested, slept on and merged with the rest of your knowledge pool. Repeating exercises and getting through with what the teacher feels its important definitely builds up character but I believe it's detrimental to one's academic career.

##### Books are the single way of learning really interesting topics.
Because if you think about it, a book is a 10 year thought out lecture that you can pause, they make you run the topics one by one until you've understood, you hopefully take notes for any future revisions and really focus on what's fun and interesting. 

And I've had my round of really good books. Griffiths' Intro to Quantum Mechanics, Intro to Electrodynamics, Boas'es Mathematical Physics, so many really good books that if someone read on their free time they would get a really, really good understanding of the subject (arguably even better than college).

Of couse you're missing the beautifully painful strict homework-test schedule, which certainly may help sometimes, especially when you need to drill something in your mind. And clearly this is by no means a substitute for college, which offers a range of other oportunities besides academics. 

That being said, if you're in high school, college or just make the necessary free time to undergo the weight of a new academic adventure, this may interest you. 

Ever wondered what a Physics Major at MIT learns? or a Economics Major at Harvard does? maybe a Mechanical Engineer at TU Munich? Well, this tool helps arrange the important path for each subject, say you wanna learn Economics; you go in the Economics section, you browse through the various universities programmes and see how they are learning, which books they're using; you read the comments on each books, maybe one is really good, maybe other is extremy dry, you can get that information; finally, you make a path of which books to learn and get on with it. It is basically as if you were studying at college! But at your own pace, with no annoying deadlines or tests, you can really focus on learning.

This is the idea, I'll follow up with the execution.
