# Apps are not that hard

I've seen, for a while now, this feeling on the internet that making apps is an exceptionally difficult task. Videos such as the "Apps: Everything You Didn't Know You Needed to Know" series make it look as if developing an app was an extraordinary mission, but it really isn't, it is in fact quite easy*, and I'm here to prove it.

*Making a huge, really succesfull app that serves millions of users may be a titanic task, but I'm talking here about a not-that-complex, well done, useful app

## Get an idea

Really important part. Normally you wanna fix a problem or create one that makes a ton of cash.

My idea: Help international students, such as myself, to visit the other student from my college that are also abroad and arrange trips together.

Get your own, it can be whatever.

## Make a mock up of the idea

Literally just dream about what this idea could be, stretch, contract as much as you want, no one is watching go crazy.
After you've dreamt a bit about what this idea could be turned into, now select the ABSOLUTELY necessary parts to make it work.
I generally do 3. This procedure probably has a fancy technical name that no one cares about, just think if your app was a church, which ideas would be the pillars. You need very good pillars.

My 3 absolutely necessary parts: 
- Make a map that shows the people
- Make a multi person trip organizer (so that if some people want to visit a country others can join them) 
- Make a simple contact system with all the necessary information (iif you have an apartment maybe you could host someone on the couch) 

Literally just draw how this will be displayed on the app:

Then just think ok, what other screens do I need? For example, I probably need a Log In Page, a Register Page and so on. Check your apps on your phone for inspiration. Draw them as well:

Cool, you've now got a decent enough wireframe. You can go as far as you want, but usually it's not worth it, just focus on the really important parts.

## Design the thing

You've got your central ideas, the MUSTs, you've got an OK wireframe, now just design the thing. You might be asking yourself "ok, how? I know nothing about design" Doesn't matter, do you know rectangles? Do you have more than 1 app installed on your phone? If you do, you're good to go.

For this we need software, install Adobe XD if you can allow it (it's free if you're in university, or at least at mine) and if you can't, that's fine, guess what? Someone took 7 years out of their life to code Photoshop on the web for free. Yeah. Photopea[https://www.photopea.com/]

Ok, if know nothing about Photoshop just go on Youtube for half an hour. Here's a quick User Interface breakdown: Everything is a rectangle. Just use that over and over again, maybe sprinkle a circle somewhere around.

You really don't need a super expensive designer to make something look decent. Google some free use illustrations to use as placeholders (or keep them, who cares, they're free) and just square things up.

Look at mine:

They're literally, by order, a red circle, some nice looking text (Poppins font), a random figure I did with the pen (you can ignore it, it's not that important), a free illustration and finally text inside some rectangles, except this time the corners are smooth. Rectangles with sprinkled circles and some text on top, real easy.

If you need any inspiration just google it or look at the apps on your phone. 

Design the MUSTs you defined and inked on the step before.

Here are mine (3 simple screens):


If you don't know where to get the icons or whatever, just google them.

### Reflect on time

I thought really hard about the app for maybe half a week, designed it in an afternoon and wrote this on the night. This is not a flex, though what it may seem, I'm simply trying to say that this process is really not that hard once you know what I've detailed before, every single step COULD take a veeery long time, but we concern yourself with that. I am not a designer (easy to see), so I make the app look decent and move on. 

Most projects are sacrificed on the name of perfeccionism, so don't bother with it a lot. Of course make it as well as you can, but a super simplified running app is 1000 times better than a perfectly thought out never to be realized app.

## Code it up (fronted)

Now this is the "hard" part, if you know nothing about apps then you better have some available hours to learn this stuff up, it's really not that hard.

Here's another rundown: 
- You can make either an Android app or an iOS app. Either one will make you lose half the market, so the correct anser is to choose both. What? Yeah, you can code once and run them on both. It has its disadvantages, but honestly who cares.
- Now you have to choose between Flutter, React Native and the thousand other libraries. My advice? Just learn React, its painfully simple, it will take you a couple weeks (from knowing absolutely nothing) and afterwards you'll be able to make web pages and other fun stuff as well.

Ok, this is basically how this apps work:
- Frontend -> What the user looks at, pretty stuff -> Learn HTML, CSS, JS and React (should take maybe a week each at most)
- Backend -> What the user doesn't look at, the database -> Since you already know JS from above, learn ExpressJS (maybe a week as well) OR if you're too cool for it, just don't learn anything and use a premade backend such as Firebase (a couple of days to learn, I swear)

For frontend there are a ton of tutorials on Youtube, how do I know? I've taken a couple. If that's not your thing just read the docs, copy paste code and stare at it until you know what it does.

This is the hardest part, but honestly HTML and CSS are so easy and tedious it makes a man want to lock himself up in the freezer just to see if the cold can make the brain go any slower.
JS is comparatively harder, but not by a lot. And React is just HTML + JS, so basically not much new, I know people that learn it in hours.
